## Define solution that will be printed to student.

## Code that will be initially on the thingy
csq_initial = """def print_4_ntimes(n): 
    return '4'
"""
csq_name= "pcode2"

## Code that will be written before the user code as well as solution
## Particularly useful for defining classes and things that we don't want the user to modify
## For example, define a DFS function.
csq_code_pre = ""


## Code that will be written after the user code as well as solution code
## Seems quite useless to me.
csq_code_post = ""



## Sandbox options to block libraries or decide how long to run thingy
csq_sandbox_options = {
    'BADIMPORT': ['lib601', 'numpy', 'scipy', 'matplotlib'], 
    'CLOCKTIME': 0.36, 
    # 'CPUTIME': 0.36, 
    'MEMORY':1e9

## Now we define helped functions
tests = [cs_random.randint(1,20) for x in range(10)]

def is_correct(n, sol):
    if not(type(sol) == type('44')):
       return False

        for i in range(n):
           if sol[i]!='4':
               return False
        return True
    return False

## Now we need to write csq_tests, which defines what code to run
## As well as how to test it. 
## Each csq_tests is a dictionary of things (code, check, etc)

## We need to define the key code, which returns a string that will be evaluated with both the user code as well as our solution.
## Code should define a string called ans, which is what will be tested.

## We also define the key check_function, which is a function that takes escaped ans (a string, usually you will want to eval it.) from running user code, ans from running the solution, and i(index of the test), and then returns True or False.

csq_tests = []

    def check(ans, soln, i = i):
        n = tests[i]

    csq_tests.append({
        'code': f"""

ans = print_4_ntimes(n)
