This class is an overview of topics covered in 6.006, taught by experienced TAs, geared toward people who have some proofs knowledge. This might help you prepare to take the class in the Spring, review the material if you have already taken it, get some experience for algorithm questions in interviews, or satisfy your curiosity about what all the hype is around algorithms. 

6.006 is an introductory course in algorithms and data structures. It covers
elementary data structures (dynamic arrays, heaps, balanced binary search trees,
hash tables) and algorithmic paradigms (brute force, divide and conquer, greedy,
dynamic programming). The material is applied to classical motivating problems
including searching, sorting, and finding shortest paths in a graph.

This class is not a substitute for 6.006. if you enjoy it, and do well on it, you should take 6.006 afterwards.  A fair comparison would be to say that in this class we will be learning some vocabulary and then practicing those words with flash cards, while in 6.006 you would write beautiful sentences with those words. 

## Schedule and Lectures

The class will meet on Monday and Wednesdays from 7-9 at 1-190. The dates are: W 01/09, M 01/14, W 01/16, W 01/23, M 01/28, and W 01/30.

In the lectures we will very quickly cover an overview of the material, but you will be expected to read notes before and after lectures.
